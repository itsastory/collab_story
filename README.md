# README

This is a collaborative text that will be used to get some feeling for git and git-hub.

It's a online variant of; "with a few sentences, continue the story where the others left of."

Aim at adding 2-3 sentences each, and don't post twice in a row.

The text will be using the GitHub-flavored markdown, help can be found here:
